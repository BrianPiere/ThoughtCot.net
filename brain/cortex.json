Then they would simply add something new in its place which is relatively free of mistakes.\n\nOver time the system grows more intelligent because the database of contradictions is timeless. In other words, there is now a way to automate mistake-avoidance in text.  \n\nJust as important, the system helps users say things which CAN be said when auto-completions are the survivors of previous CANT's."
